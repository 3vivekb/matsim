/**
 * Package that takes demand and infrastructure (roads, ...) as input and runs an adaptive "minibus" model to serve that demand.
 * The resulting minibus lines can for example be used as follows:<ul>
 * <li> As a starting point to construct a schedule for formal public transit.
 * <li> As paratransit supply for scenarios where no information about paratransit is available.
 * </ul>
 * Look into {@link playground.andreas.P2} to get started.
 * <p/>
 * Some publications (list not regularly updated):<ul>
 * 
 * <li> Ph.D. dissertation of Andreas Neumann, see <a href="http://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-tuberlin/frontdoor/index/index/docId/5386"> here </a>
