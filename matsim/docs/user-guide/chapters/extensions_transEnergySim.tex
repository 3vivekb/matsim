\section{Transportation Energy Simulation Framework (transEnergySim)}

\subsubsection{[module is still under construction]}

In this MATSim contribution a framework to simulate a whole range  oftranportation related energy scenarios is implemented. The focus  is on electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. This contributio  is being built and updated as part of the PhD ofRashid A. Waraich  (waraich at ivt.baug.ethz.ch). As this is an open source project, which  encourages contribution by others, there are also modules, which have  been contriubted by the following people: Dr. Matthias D. Galus, Gil  Georges ?, Marina ?, Zain?, Raffaela?, etc.?



The following modules should be available soon/ are planned:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Inductive charging along roads
	\item Charging at activity location
	\item Several charging schemes including smart charging ("smart grid")
	\item V2G
	\item General energy flow model
	\item buy/sell of electricity price over market
\end{itemize}

These features require several basic constructs, which willalso be documented soon here:
\begin{itemize}
	\item vehicle fleet definition model
	\item vehicle energy consumption model
	\item charging infrastructure definition model
	\item output modules
	\item more to come here...
\end{itemize}

If you want to contribute with a new module to the framework  (e.g. for charging, energy consumption, emissions, etc.), please contact  Rashid A. Waraich (waraich at ivt.baug.ethz.ch).
