\chapter{Policy Measures}

A discussion of policy measures that can be investigated with matsim is under \href{http://matsim.org/policy-measures}{matsim.org/policy-measures}  . It is not in the user section but in the developer section of  the documentation since, at this point, many of those measures need  additional coding. Clearly, something like adding or removing lanes or  links can be investigated without any coding.
