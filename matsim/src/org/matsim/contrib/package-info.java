/**
 * This package contains contributions to MATSim. Contributions are classes
 * that do something useful and could be used by others.  This implies that
 * contributions should be considered as stable and already have been proved
 * to work well and be useful in some project or another.
 *
 * Code in these packages is provided as-is. Support, if any, is provided by
 * the package-authors, but not by the common MATSim support team.
 *
 * To add your contributions to this package, you must abide by the following
 * rules:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Contributions must be placed in their own package.</li>
 *   <li>Contributions must only import/refer to code from org.matsim.*, but
 *       not from classes located in a playground.</li>
 *   <li>Contributions must be documented. Documentation includes at least the
 *       information who created the contribution and what the contribution
 *       can be used for. Additional information like how it is to be used,
 *       how it can be configured, and who may give support (if different
 *       from the author) would also be helpful. Documentation should be
 *       written into a file "package-info.java" as Javadoc on the top-level
 *       of the contribution-package.</li>
 *   <li>If contributions are heavily dependent on certain scenarios or
 *       strongly related to work being done at a specific university, this
 *       fact should be recognizable from the package name, e.g.
 *       <tt>org.matsim.contrib.vsp.*</tt> or
 *       <tt>org.matsim.contrib.scenarioCH.*</tt>. Such packages serve as
 *       examples how something can be done, and not necessarily to be reused
 *       without adaptation.</li>
 * </ul>
