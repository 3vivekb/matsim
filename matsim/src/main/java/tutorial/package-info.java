/**
<p>This package contains the classes referenced in the MATSim Tutorial "Getting started with MATSim".</p>
<p>{@link tutorial.old.example1.MyControler1} introduced reading of network and plans, writing of events and running the mobility simulation a single time.</p>
<p>{@link tutorial.old.example2.MyControler2} adds visualizer output.</p>
<p>{@link tutorial.old.example3.MyControler3} makes use of a configuration file instead of hard-coding all settings.</p>
<p>{@link tutorial.old.example4.MyControler4} calculates the score of the individual plans as well as the average score.</p>
<p>{@link tutorial.old.example5.MyControler5} adds an iteration loop and re-planning to create a real agent-based simulation with agent learning.</p>
