	 * <li>This might be better as a Map.  However, as a Map all objects need to have an Id.  And the Id needs to be unique,
	 * since java does not have multi-maps.  Which means that we come back to the question of what should be in here and what not.
	 * For that reason, it is just a Collection.</li>
