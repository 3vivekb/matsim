Change name of framework to TESF (Transportation Energy Simulation Framework) or 
MESF (Mobility Energy Simulation Framework).



next:
- add general charging cases also...



===========
- TO START PSS:
1.) make results folder empty (a:\data\results
2.) copy initial prices to: a:\data\PSS\output\hubPriceInfo.txt (for input of MATSim) 
and a:\data\PSS\input\initialNodePriceInfo.txt (for input to PSS).


Notes:
======
- the price info file in an iteration folder are the input of MATSim and the
vehicle energy consumptions are the output of MATSim.
