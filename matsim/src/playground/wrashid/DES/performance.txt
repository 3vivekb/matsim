=======================
1 Iteration with 67000 agents (test 6, 10% Zurich), with EventWriterTXT on, took on
DEQSim: 122 sec.
JavaMobSiM: 423sec.
(on my office computer)

DEQSim without EventProcessing is: 37sec.
Using addional Thread for EventProcessing, DEQSim is reduced to 86sec.
This means, we have reached the maximum throughput for this (as only one handler and no further parallelization possible).

==================
1 Iteration, 67K run, on Satwal:
DEQSim inklusive exra thread for eventProcessing: 125 sec.
DEQSim inklusive exra thread for eventProcessing + lesser locking/more copying of lists: 100 sec.
(this needs 88sec instead of 86 on office computer)
DEQSim events turned off: 41sec. 
JavaMobSim: 461sec.

=> experiment: 1 million synchronized cost arround 8.7 seconds on Satawal.
In general it was found, that Satawal is much more sensitive to locking, than my office computer.
office computer = dual core, AMD optron 2.2GHz

memory at same place in simulation:
office computer: 
used RAM: 881376096B = 860718kB = 840MB  free: 184108192B = 175MB  total: 1065484288B = 1016MB
satwal:
used RAM: 1061712368B = 1036828kB = 1012MB  free: 367889936B = 350MB  total: 1429602304B = 1363MB
=> probably because satawal uses 64bit JVM.
