=======================
1 Iteration with 67000 agents (test 6, 10% Zurich), with EventWriterTXT on, took on
DEQSim: 122 sec.
JavaMobSiM: 423sec.


DEQSim without EventProcessing is: 37sec.
Using addional Thread for EventProcessing, DEQSim is reduced to 86sec.
This means, we have reached the maximum throughput for this (as only one handler and no further parallelization possible).
