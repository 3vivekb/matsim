- the idea is basically the same as with PDES1, that we try to provide a lookahead.
- But instead of doing it on road level, we do it on zone levels.


- each road needs to be assigned to a zone (based on its location => two passes of road files needed)
- a link can only belong to one zone at a time

- At the beginning: Initialize Zones.
     - This means: All roads which (potentially could) flow into different zones, must periodically schedule self/null messages.
     - This enables each zone to start
     
- The message queue of a zone can only be processed, if
              - a message has arrived from all incoming links to the zone
              - and only those messages can be processed, with a time stamp smaller than the time stamp of the smallest message
                from any incoming link
                
                
- a zone can be assigned to any executor thread. This means there can be more zones than processes. Any zones, which can progress
is just processed. Making more zones than threads/processors probably also leads to less waiting on locks? But on the other hand
it leads to more border links (really?).
