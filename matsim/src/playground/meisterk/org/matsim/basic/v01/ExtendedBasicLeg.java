		 * This variable is used to differentiate chain-based and trip-based modes.

		 * If a car, bike or other individual means of transport is to be used on a tour, 
		 * it must be used for the entire chain, since the car/bike must be 
		 * returned home or to the respective anchor point at the end of the tour ("chain-based modes"). 
		 * Furthermore, a chain-based mode cannot be used if it is not available at the anchor point
		 * at the beginning of the tour.
		 * No such constraints, however, exists with respect to other modes such as walk and public transport modes,
		 * ("trip-based modes").
		 * 
		 * [TODO] One could discuss if "ride" is a trip-based or a chain-based mode.
